# Clean-install smoke test.
#
# Builds the wheel and installs it into a FRESH virtualenv with NO dev/test
# dependencies and NO lockfile, so runtime dependencies resolve exactly as a
# plain `pip install quelle` would for an end user (latest `typer`, etc.) —
# not the pinned versions the dev lock happens to hold. Then it exercises the
# installed CLI, in particular `quelle schema`, the self-describing contract.
#
# This guards the "works in dev, broken on install" class of bug: an undeclared
# dependency that is only present transitively in dev, or a behaviour change in
# the version users actually get. (See quelle v0.9.1 / the typer-vendored-click
# regression.) Such a bug fails here instead of reaching a release.
